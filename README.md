# Description:
The Blockchain Certificate Manager is a Python-based project that implements a blockchain-like system for certificate validation and generation. This project combines cryptographic hashing using hashlib for data integrity and computer vision with OpenCV for enhanced security features. The repository provides a scalable and secure solution for creating and validating certificates.

# Key Features:

# Blockchain Structure:

The project follows a blockchain structure for storing certificates, ensuring data integrity through cryptographic hashing.

# Genesis Block:

The system begins with a genesis block, providing a starting point for the blockchain.

# Certificate Creation:

Users can generate new certificates by providing unique certificate IDs and issuer information.

# Data Validation:

Certificates are validated by comparing their data with the corresponding block in the blockchain.

# Contributing:
